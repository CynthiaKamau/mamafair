      <h2>PRE NATAL INFORMATION </h2>
      <h3>KEEPING WOMEN INFORMED</h3>

<p>Care should be centred on the pregnant woman; the aim should be to keep her fully informed on the progress of her pregnancy and to provide her with evidence-based information and support to make informed decisions.</p>

<p>At first contact with a health professional, she should be given:

    Information on where antenatal care will be offered and by whom, including choice of providers where available and information about antenatal screening.
    Information about folic acid supplementation.
    Lifestyle advice including:
        Food hygiene and safe eating in pregnancy.
        Smoking cessation.
        Advice about avoidance of alcohol and illicit drugs in pregnancy.
    Medication advice (review of safety of any current medication in pregnancy and avoidance of over-the-counter (OTC) medication which may not be used in pregnancy).</p>

<P>At booking, she should be given:

    Information about the development of the baby during pregnancy.
    The choice of attending antenatal classes.
    Written information about antenatal care - for example, the book "The Pregnancy Book" available from Health Departments.[2]Patients with loss of sight or hearing, learning difficulties or poor comprehension of English should have the information provided in a way that is understandable to them.
    Advice about exercise.
    Information and choice regarding the place of birth.
    Information regarding nutrition and diet.
    Information about breast-feeding.
    Further explanation of antenatal screening.
    The opportunity to discuss any mental health issues.</P>

<P>Before or at 36 weeks, she should be given:
<ul>
    <li> Information about breast-feeding.</li>
    <li> Information to prepare her for labour and birth (birth plan, pain relief options, how to recognise the onset of active labour).</li>
    <li> Information about care of the new baby and preparations needed.</li>
    <li>Information about routine procedures such as newborn screening and vitamin K prophylaxis.</li>
    <li>Advice about postnatal self-care, along with information about postnatal depression and "baby blues".</li>
    </ul>
            </P>
                              <!--adding the collapsing button-->    
                              
            <h4>Other general principles</h4>

            <p> In uncomplicated pregnancies, midwife/GP care should normally be offered, with specialist care readily available when complications occur.</p>
            <p>The patient should be seen by a small group of professionals who provide continuity of care.</p>
            <p> Antenatal care should be readily and easily accessible and should be in an environment which enables women to discuss confidential issues such as domestic violence, sexually transmitted infections, mental health problems or recreational drug use.</p>
   <p> Assessment of gestational age should be based on an early ultrasound scan rather than the last menstrual period. Such scans should be offered to all women between 10 and 13 weeks and help to ensure:
       <ul>
           <li> Consistency of gestational age assessments.</li>
           <li>Multiple pregnancy is picked up early.</li>
           <li> Improved accuracy of Down's screening assessment.</li>
           <li>Sensible decisions on induction of labour after 41 weeks.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>At 38 weeks, she should be given:

    Information about management options for prolonged pregnancy.</p>



                            <h4 id="PE0">  Mental Health </h4>

<p>Be alert to mental health problems - current or potential. The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) updated its advice on mental health in pregnancy and the postnatal period on 2014. Guidance advises healthcare professionals, at a woman's first contact with primary care, her booking visit and during the early postnatal period, to:
    <ul>

        <li> Consider asking questions to screen for depression and anxiety as part of a general discussion about a woman's mental health and well-being.</li>
        <li>Ask about any past or present severe mental illness.</li>
        <li> Ask about past or present treatment by a specialist mental health service, including inpatient care</li>
        <li> Ask about any severe perinatal mental illness in a first-degree relative.</li>
            </ul>
<p>In women with established mental health issues, consider the needs of partners, families and carers that might affect a woman with a mental health problem in pregnancy and the postnatal period. These include:
    <ul>

        <li>The welfare of the baby and other dependent children and adults.</li>
        <li> The role of the partner, family or carer in providing support.</li>
        <li> The potential effect of any mental health problem on the woman's relationship with her partner, family or carer.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>

     <h4 id="PE1"> Advice on Employment </h4>

<p>Advise on maternity rights and benefits. Pregnant women have the right to:
    <ul>
        <li> Paid time off for antenatal care and classes.</li>
        <li>Maternity leave.</li>
        <li> Maternity pay or maternity allowance.</li>
        <li>Protection against unfair treatment, discrimination or dismissal. Contracts cannot be changed without agreement.</li>
                </ul>

<p>Note that Maternity Leave and Statutory Maternity Pay will start automatically if the employee is off work for a pregnancy-related illness in the four weeks before the baby is due.</p>

<p>For most women, it is safe to continue working in pregnancy, so reassure where appropriate. However, ask about occupation and consider potential exposure to harmful agents. It is an employer's responsibility to assess risk when informed of a woman's pregnancy. If a risk is established, it is their responsibility to find alternative duties or suspend on full pay. Further information for expectant mothers and for employers is available on the Health and Safety Executive website.</p>

    <p>The maternity certificate MAT B1 form should be signed to enable a pregnant woman to claim Statutory Maternity Pay (SMP) from her employer or Maternity Allowance (MA) from Jobcentre Plus.[6]It can be signed from 20 weeks before the estimated date of delivery (EDD) and doctors or midwives are required to sign this free of charge.</p>
            
     <h4 id="PE2">  Advice on Nutrition </h4>

<p>Pregnant women should be encouraged to have a normal, balanced, healthy diet. Because of the dangers of toxoplasmosis and listeriosis, women should avoid:
                <ul>
                <li> Uncooked meat or fish.</li>
                <li> Raw or partially cooked eggs, and products such as fresh mayonnaise which may contain raw eggs.</li>
                <li> Milk that has not been pasteurised.</li>
                <li> Soft cheeses which are mould-ripened or made from unpasteurised milk, such as Brie and Camembert, or soft blue-veined cheeses such as Danish Blue.</li>
                <li>Pâté of any sort.</li>
                <li>Raw shellfish.</li>
                <li> Shark, swordfish and marlin (due to high mercury levels).</li>
                <li>More than two portions per week of oily fish.</li>
                <li>Unwashed fruit or vegetables. (Fruit and vegetables should be washed due to the small risk of toxoplasma from soil.)</li>
              </ul>

<p>Vegetarians, and especially vegans, may be at risk of nutritional deficiencies and may need to be referred to a dietician for advice about obtaining all nutrients through diet.

Women should be cautioned to avoid many herbal preparations and teas; their use and safety in pregnancy have not been studied.</p>
                
 <h4 id="PE3"> Advice on Supplements </h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Folic acid</li>
                </ul>

<p>All women intending to become pregnant, and those who are, should be advised to take 400 micrograms of folic acid up to 12 weeks of gestation to reduce incidence of fetal neural tube defects (NTDs). Supplementation with folic acid is one of the most significant interventions available. 400 micrograms/day for all women have been shown consistently to reduce the incidence of NTDs, such as spina bifida, significantly.</p>

<p>Women who have already given birth to a child with an NTD, or have a family history of NTD or who are at a higher risk, should be prescribed 5 mg/day. This dose is also recommended for women with diabetes (types 1 or 2).</p>

<p>This is given for at least one month prior to conception and three months afterwards. Diet alone does not reliably supply an adequate amount of folic acid for this effect. It can be prescribed or bought over-the-counter (OTC) cheaply.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Vitamin D</li>
                </ul>

Adequate vitamin D stores during pregnancy and breast-feeding are important for the health of both mother and baby. All women should be advised to take vitamin D supplements (10 micrograms = 400 units per day). The following groups are at higher risk and should take 1,000 units per day:
<ul>
    <li>Housebound women or those who have limited exposure to sunlight, such as women who usually remain covered when outdoors.</li>
    <li> South Asian, African, Caribbean or Middle Eastern family origin.</li>
    <li> Women with a pre-pregnancy BMI more than 30 kg/m2.</li>
    <li>Women with a high risk of pre-eclampsia (should take at least 800 units per day combined with calcium.)</li>
</ul>
Caution with vitamin D supplementation is needed in women with sarcoidosis or renal disease.

    <p> <ul><li>Iron</li></ul>
    

Iron should not be offered routinely as it has no benefit to either mother or baby and may cause constipation and other side-effects. Women should be given dietary advice, encouraging dietary intake of iron. Where supplementation is required, this will be picked up on routine blood tests at booking and 28 weeks.

            <p>Anaemia is defined in pregnancy as:</p>
            <ul>

                <li> Hb less than 110 g/L in the first trimester.</li>
                <li> Hb less than 105 g/L in the second and third trimesters.</li>
                <li> Hb less than 100 g/L postpartum.</li>
            </ul>
If established, it should be treated with 100-200 mg of oral elemental iron per day for three months and for at least six weeks postpartum.

                <p>  <ul><li>Other vitamins</li></ul>

<p>Women should be warned that high levels of vitamin A may be teratogenic and therefore that they should avoid extra supplementation. Liver and liver products may contain high levels of vitamin A and should be avoided. Where using multivitamin preparations, women should use those which are specifically designed for pregnancy. Pregnant women on low incomes can obtain vouchers for vitamins from the Healthy Start programme in the UK.</p>
                <h4> Advice on medication</h4>

<p>Advise women to use as few medicines as possible during pregnancy and only when benefit outweighs risk. This includes OTC medication and complementary therapies, as few products have been shown to be definitely safe during pregnancy. Ideally review any regular medication pre-conception but, if this has not been done, as soon as possible in pregnancy.</p>
                
                 <h4 id="PE4">  Advice on Lifestyle </h4>
                <ul>
                    <li> Exercise</li></ul>

<p>Women who exercise regularly should be advised to continue to do so. Those who are inactive should start a gentle programme of regular exercise. Moderate exercise has not been shown to cause any harm but the patient should be warned of the dangers of highly energetic and contact sports that would risk damage to the abdomen, falls or excessive joint stress.</p>

<p>Scuba diving should be avoided, as it can cause fetal birth defects and fetal decompression disease.</p>
                <p><ul>
                <li>Sexual intercourse</li></ul></p>

<p>This has not been shown to cause any harm during pregnancy. It may be advisable to avoid it if there is risk of preterm rupture of membranes or if there is placenta praevia, although evidence is limited.</p>
                <ul><li>Alcohol</li></ul>

<p>High levels of alcohol consumption during pregnancy may result in the fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS). There are various components including growth restriction, general learning disability, facial anomalies and behavioural problems. Not all women who drink heavily in pregnancy have babies with FAS, so there are other components, which are as yet poorly understood.</p>

<p>It is not known how much alcohol is safe to drink in pregnancy. Current advice from the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists (RCOG), NICE and the British Medical Association (BMA) is that women should not drink alcohol at all in the first three months of pregnancy. (This is because of the increased risk of miscarriage.) For the rest of pregnancy, women are advised ideally not to drink at all; however, if they do, to restrict it to a maximum of one or two units at a maximum of once or twice per week.</p>
   <ul><li>             
       Smoking</li></ul>

<p>Smoking in pregnancy is associated with a large number of adverse effects in pregnancy including:
    <ul>
        <li>Intrauterine growth restriction and low birth weight.</li>
        <li> Miscarriage and stillbirth.</li>
        <li> Premature delivery.</li>
        <li> Placental problems.</li></ul>
                

<p>There is evidence that quitting smoking early reduces risks.NICE guidelines encourage GPs and midwives to be proactive in helping with this. Women should be asked about smoking at their first contact and at each subsequent appointment if they are smokers. Offer referral to NHS smoking services and give them the number of the NHS Smoking Helpline (0800 123 1044). Information about the risks of smoking to the fetus and the mother and then of secondhand smoke to a newborn baby should be given.</p>

<p>There is little information on the use of nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) in pregnancy but smoking gives a greater dose of nicotine and also exposes mother and fetus to other toxins. It is likely to be safer than smoking in mothers for whom non-pharmacological interventions have failed. If a woman expresses a clear wish to receive NRT, use professional judgement when deciding whether to offer a prescription. Advise pregnant women using nicotine patches to remove them before going to bed.</p>

Neither bupropion nor varenicline should be prescribed in pregnancy.
               <p> <ul><li>
                Recreational drug use</li></ul></p>

<p>The number of women misusing drugs has increased considerably in the past few decades and many are in their child-bearing years. Though pregnancy may act as a catalyst for change and present a "window of opportunity", drug misusers may not use general health services until late into pregnancy and this increases the health risks for both the mother and child.</p>

   <p> A multidisciplinary approach is essential. Most localities will have a clearly defined drug dependency service with a readily accessible entry point.</p>
   <p> Cocaine use in pregnancy is particularly serious and there is no substitute. It has been associated with spontaneous abortion, placental abruption, premature birth, low birth weight and sudden infant death syndrome. There is conflicting evidence regarding fetal abnormalities.</p>
   <p> Opiate use is associated with increased incidence of intrauterine growth restriction and preterm delivery. This contributes to an increased rate of low birth weight and perinatal mortality. Maintenance treatment with an opiate substitute improves outcomes.</p>
    <p>Women addicted to heroin who wish to become pregnant should be urged to enter a detoxification programme before conception and, if not, then at least be stabilised on methadone. Buprenorphine is also used as a substitute with apparently similar outcomes in pregnancy.</p>
    <p>HIV and hepatitis B screening is carried out in all pregnant women in the UK but is especially important in known IV drug users. Hepatitis C screening is also recommended in this group.</p>
   <p> The use of cannabis may be harmful to the fetus and is also associated with smoking and should be discouraged.
       Cochrane reviews have found no convincing evidence for psychosocial interventions.</p>

            <p> <ul><li>Travel</li></ul></p>

<p>Flying is associated with increased risk of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) but it is not known if the risk is further increased in pregnancy. Use of compression hosiery reduces the risk in the general population. Also discuss vaccinations and travel insurance if travelling abroad. There is no evidence that flying is associated with an increased risk of miscarriage or premature labour. Airlines have their own guidance about from what gestation pregnant women should not fly for practical reasons.

Advise on proper use of seat belts for car travel, with belts above and below bump rather than over it.</p>
    <p><ul><li><b>Treating symptoms of early pregnancy</b></li></ul></p>

<p>Nausea and vomiting of pregnancy generally resolve by 12-20 weeks of gestation. Cochrane reviews have failed to find evidence of efficacy and safety for any of the many treatments used.[21]There was little evidence found for the efficacy of acupuncture. Ginger, anti-emetics and antihistamines are often used.</p>

<p>Heartburn may be alleviated by taking small meals and raising the head of the bed. It may need antacids. The manufacturers of Gaviscon® state it is safe for use in pregnancy.</p>

<p>Constipation is another common symptom in early pregnancy. Women should be advised on diet to combat this (fluids and increasing dietary fibre) or may use bran or wheat fibre supplementation.</p>
    
                 <h5 id="PE5"> <b>Advice on Appointments and Doctor's visits</b></h5>

                <p>The following number of appointments is generally recommended in uncomplicated pregnancies:</p>
<ul>
    <li> Nulliparous women - 10</li>
    <li> Parous women - 7</li></ul>

<p>Information about the timing and function of these appointments should be given to the woman in writing with the chance to discuss them with her doctor or midwife. Appointments should have a focus and structure and include routine tests where possible.</p>

<p>All appointments should include measuring BP and testing urine for proteinuria. Pre-eclampsia occurs more frequently in:</p>
<ul>
    <li> Those with a previous history.</li>
    <li>The nulliparous.</li>
    <li> Multiple pregnancies.</li>
    <li>Those aged over 40.</li>
    <li>Those with a close family history.</li>
    <li> Those where BMI is over 35 at first presentation.</li>
    <li> Those with pre-existing vascular disease - eg, hypertension.</li>
    <li>Those with pre-existing renal disease.</li>
    <li>Those with pre-existing diabetes.</li></ul>

<p>They should also be used as an opportunity to give information and allow the patient to ask questions and discuss any topics which are of concern to her. Domestic violence is a subject that pregnant women should be encouraged to discuss openly.</p>
                <b> First (booking) appointment</b>

                <p>This should be before 12 weeks of pregnancy, ideally by week 10. There may need to be two appointments because of the volume of information required to be imparted. All information should initially be offered verbally and backed up in writing with an opportunity to discuss and ask questions.</p>

                <p> Lifestyle topics such as diet, alcohol, smoking, exercises, etc,  together with antenatal care services available and maternity benefits should be covered. Initial measurement of weight, BMI and BP. Repeated weighing is only appropriate in later pregnancy where it is likely to affect management.</p>
                <p>The clinician needs to provide enough information to make an informed decision about undergoing available screening tests.</p>
                
    Offer screening of mother for:
                <ul>
                    <li> Anaemia.</li>
                    <li> Red cell allo-antibodies.</li>
                    <li> Hepatitis B virus.</li>
                    <li> HIV.</li>
                    <li>Rubella susceptibility.</li>
                    <li>Syphilis.</li>
                    <li>Chlamydia for women under the age of 25 via the chlamydia national screening programme.</li>
                    <li>Asymptomatic bacteriuria.</li>
                    <li>Sickle cell and thalassaemia screening (offer to all women, using the national Family Origin Questionnaire to establish level of risk).</li></ul>
        <p>Screening for gestational diabetes in women with risk factors:
            <ul>
                <li> BMI less than 30.</li>
                <li>Previous gestational diabetes.</li>
                <li> Previous baby with a weight equal or more than 4.5 kg.</li>
                <li>First-degree relative with diabetes.</li>
                <li>Afro-Caribbean or South Asian or Middle Eastern origin.</li></ul>
                Arrange as agreed.
    <p>Offer screening of fetus for chromosomal abnormalities:
            <p> Down's syndrome, Edwards' syndrome and Patau's syndrome.</p>

                <p> NB: Ensure the patient is aware that she is not obliged to have these screening tests and that they are not 100% reliable. Screening in the first trimester will be by the combined screening test (this involves a nuchal translucency measurement via scan and serum tests). The combined screening test can take place between 10 and 14 weeks of gestation. If a woman books too late for the combined screening test, she can be offered the quadruple serum screening test up until 20 weeks of gestation.</p>
   <p> All women should be offered screening of foetus for other structural anomalies by ultrasound scan at 18-20 weeks.
    It is necessary to identify those women who may require extra care and create a plan for this. Identify those with increased risk of pre-eclampsia. Ask about any current or previous significant medical or psychiatric illnesses.</p>

                <h2>POST NATAL INFORMATION </h2>
            <p>
            The puerperium covers the six-week period following birth, during which time the various changes that occurred during pregnancy revert to the non-pregnant state. Physiological changes during this time include:
<ul>
    <li>The cardiovascular system reverts to normal during the first two weeks. The extra load on the heart from the extra volume of blood disappears by the second week.</li>
    <li>The vaginal wall is initially swollen, bluish and pouting but rapidly regains its tone, although remaining fragile for 1-2 weeks. Perineal oedema may persist for some days.</li>
    <li>>After delivery of the placenta, the uterus is the size of a 20-week pregnancy; however, it reduces in size on abdominal examination by one finger-breadth each day, such that on the 12th day it cannot be palpated. By the end of the puerperium it is only slightly larger than pre-pregnancy.</li>
    <li>For the first 3-4 days, lochia comprises mainly blood and remnants of trophoblastic tissue. During days 3-12 the colour is reddish-brown but then changes to yellow. Occasionally, lochia may become red again for a few days, due to thrombi from the ends of vessels.</li></ul>

            <p> <h5 id="PN0"> Common Puerperal problems</h5>
<p>
    Perineum</p>

   <p> If the perineum has been damaged and repaired it may cause considerable pain, requiring analgesia. Women may prefer to sit on a rubber ring.
       If the perineum is painful, it is important to check the sutures and check for any signs of infection. Occasionally, sutures may need to be removed.</p>

            <p>Micturition</p>

    <p>Retention of urine can occur (possibly secondary to pudendal nerve bruising) and can occasionally require catheterisation[1].
        Approximately 50% of women will develop some urinary incontinence and this usually takes the form of stress incontinence. This may persist after the pregnancy. Pelvic floor exercises should be taught and encouraged</p>

            <p>Bowel problems</p>

            <p>constipation may be a problem for a short time and stool softeners may be useful.
                Haemorrhoids may be more painful after the birth than before. These can occasionally appear for the first time perinatally and normally disappear within a few weeks.</p>

            <p>Mastitis</p>

    <p>Mastitis may be due to failure to express milk from one part of the breast. It can be treated by ensuring all milk is expressed, feeding on the affected side first so this side is emptied most effectively.
    It may be complicated by infection with Staphylococcus aureus and require treatment with flucloxacillin.
        Very occasionally, a breast abscess develops and requires incision and drainage.</p>

            <p>Dyspareunia</p>

    <p>Ask about resumption of intercourse 2-6 weeks following delivery; examination of the perineum may be appropriate in women with dyspareunia who had perineal trauma.
        Discomfort during intercourse, especially in a woman who is breast-feeding, may be helped by using lubricant.</p>

            <p>Backache</p>

   <p> This may persist after the birth and affects approximately a third of women.
       Pain may be considerable and last for several months - occasionally much longer.</p>

            <p>Anaemia</p>
This is common and may easily be overlooked.

            <p>Psychological problems</p>
<p>'Baby blues': on days 3-5, a large proportion of women become temporarily sad, anxious, irritable and emotional:

    The precise cause of this is unknown and may involve hormonal changes, reaction to the reality of motherhood and doubts by the mother about her ability to care for the child.
    Management consists of an explanation and reassurance; the feelings should go within a few days.
    If symptoms do not resolve, the woman should be assessed for postnatal depression.</p>

            <p> <H5 id="PN1">Serious maternal health problems</H5>
            
            <p>Mental health problems</p>

   <p> Women are at their highest risk of having severe mental illness when pregnant and soon afterwards than at any other time in their lives.
       In the five-year period between 2009-2013, there were 101 late maternal deaths due to suicide in the UK (2.3 per 100,000 maternities) and 58 as a result of substance misuse</p>
    <p>Screening questions for depression and anxiety should be considered in the early postnatal period
        Around 10-15% of women experience postnatal depression which may present at any time during the first year after delivery.</p>
            <p> Postpartum psychosis:</p>
            <p>This affects 1-2/1,000 women following delivery and usually appears as mania or depression but women sometimes present with apparent schizophrenia</p>
            <p>It usually begins abruptly at 5-15 days, initially with confusion, anxiety, restlessness and sadness.</p>
            <p>There is rapid development of delusions - eg, the baby has died or is deformed - or hallucinations with deepening melancholia.
                Any woman with symptoms suggestive of postpartum psychosis should be referred to a secondary mental health service for assessment within four hours. Admission to hospital is usual and ideally this should be to a specialist mother and baby unit.</p>

            <p>Substance misuse:</p>
       <p> In the five-year period between 2009-2013, 58 women in the UK died as a result of substance misuse (alcohol and/or drugs) either during their pregnancy or up to one year later
        Clinicians need to ensure that their attitude does not prevent women who misuse substances from accessing the care and support that they need
           A recent significant change in mental state or new symptoms, new thoughts or acts of self-harm or new and persistent expressions of inadequacy as a mother are all 'red flags' for urgent senior psychiatric assessment.</p>

            <p>Postpartum haemorrhage</p>

   <p> Primary postpartum haemorrhage is defined as loss of more than 500 ml of blood during the first 24 hours:
       
        Normally, 200-600 ml of blood are lost before myometrial retraction plus strong uterine contractions stop flow.
        The majority of cases are associated with either an atonic uterus or placental remnants. The remainder are associated with laceration of the genital tract, rarely uterine rupture or blood coagulation defect.
        Treatment in situations where the placenta is still in the uterus is the combination of controlled cord traction with fundal pressure. If this fails, manual removal of the placenta under general anaesthesia is carried out.
       If the placenta has already been expelled, treatment includes massaging the uterus, intravenous (IV) ergometrine or syntocinon, or misoprostol, blood transfusion, correction of coagulation defects, and bimanual compression of the uterus; urgent transfer to theatre for surgery may be required.</p>
   <p> Secondary postpartum haemorrhage is abnormal bleeding after 24 hours up until six weeks postpartum:
        Usual causes are:
       <ul>
           <li>  Endometritis.</li>
           <li> Retained placental fragment and/or blood clots (usually detected by ultrasound)</li></ul>
        The uterus is often found to be bulky and tender with the cervix open.
            Initially, it is treated with removal of any clot visible within the os, plus antibiotics. Elective curettage may be required if bleeding persists despite this.

            <p>Puerperal pyrexia</p>

    <p>Puerperal pyrexia is defined as temperature 38°C or above during the first 14 days after delivery.
    Although this now occurs rarely in high-income countries, it remains an important cause of maternal death.
    Most cases are due to anaerobic streptococci that normally inhabit the vagina. Initially, they infect the placental bed and then spread either into the parametrium or via the uterine cavity to the Fallopian tubes and, occasionally, the pelvic peritoneum.
        Alternatively, there may be breast infection or urinary tract infection.</p>

            <p>Thromboembolism</p>

            <p> This occurs in about 1/1,000 pregnancies. It is 4-5 times more likely in pregnancy than in the non-pregnant woman. The puerperium is the time of highest risk (20-fold increased risk). It is more likely to occur in women who are overweight, over the age of 35 years or who have had a caesarean section.</p>
   <p> Thromboembolism is the leading cause of direct maternal mortality in the UK
       Treatment is with low molecular weight heparin (LMWH). This should be started immediately on suspicion of a thromboembolism (unless strongly contra-indicated), until the diagnosis is excluded.</p>
            
            <p> Deep vein thrombosis (DVT):</p>
            
       <p> Leg pain and swelling (usually unilateral). Calf muscles are tender and painful on firm palpation. There may be low abdominal pain or thigh pain and tenderness. Low-grade fever (less than 38oC) may occur.
        Clinical signs are unreliable (and D-dimer cannot be used in pregnancy and puerperium), so confirmation is needed with compression duplex ultrasound.
        Treatment is with LMWH which should be started immediately on suspicion of DVT.
           If the ultrasound is negative but DVT is still suspected, LMWH can be stopped but the ultrasound repeated on days 3 and 7.</p>
            
            <p> Pulmonary embolism (PE):</p>
       <p> Suspected PE is an emergency: 15% of patients with a PE in pregnancy will die, 2/3 of them within 30 minutes.
        Dyspnoea, haemoptysis and pleural pain; cyanosis may develop later. Massive PE may present with collapse.
        Friction rub may be heard in the chest.
        ECG should be performed. It will be abnormal in 41% but may suggest an alternative diagnosis, such as coronary heart disease.
        CXR should be performed. It will be abnormal in under 50% but may suggest an alternative diagnosis, such as pneumothorax.
        If DVT is also suspected, PE may be diagnosed and treatment started if DVT is confirmed on compression duplex ultrasound.
        If DVT is not suspected, a ventilation/perfusion (V/Q) scan or computerised tomography pulmonary angiogram (CTPA) should be performed.
        Treatment is with LMWH (IV unfractionated heparin bolus followed by infusion +/- thrombolysis for massive PE).
           Self-administered LMWH or oral warfarin is continued for at least three months. LMWH is associated with a significantly lower risk of post-thrombotic syndrome compared with warfarin.</p>

            <p> <h5 id="PN2"> Postnatal care</h5>

            <p>This is based on National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidance</p>

    <p>Women should be offered information to enable them to promote their own and their baby's health and well-being and to recognise and respond to problems.
    At the first postnatal contact, women should be advised of the signs and symptoms of haemorrhage, infection, thromboembolism and pre-eclampsia/eclampsia and the appropriate action to take.
    All maternity care providers should encourage breast-feeding.
    At each postnatal contact, women should be asked about their emotional well-being, what family and social support they have and their usual coping strategies for dealing with day-to-day matters.
    Women and their families/partners should be encouraged to tell their healthcare professional about any changes in mood, emotional state and behaviour that are outside of the woman's normal pattern.
    At each postnatal contact, parents should be offered information and advice to enable them to:
        <ul>
            <li> Assess their baby's general condition.</li>
            <li> Identify signs and symptoms of common health problems seen in babies.</li>
            <li> Contact a healthcare professional or emergency service if required.</li></ul>

            <p> <h5 id="PN3"> Maternal activity </h5>

    <p>The mother should start walking about as soon as possible, go to the toilet when necessary and rest when she needs to. She may prefer to stay in bed for the first 24 hours or longer if she has an extensive perineal repair.
    This is an important time for the woman to be encouraged to breast-feed and learn to care for her infant.
        Uterine contractions continue after birth and some women experience after-pains, particularly when breast-feeding. Analgesics may be required.</p>

            <p> <h5 id="PN4">Infant Feeding </h5>

    <p>Whether they chose to breast-feed or bottle-feed, women often need a lot of advice and support, especially with their first baby (but experienced mothers shouldn't be assumed to know everything and support and advice should always be available).
    Breast-feeding should be strongly encouraged (first-time mothers may need a lot of support and encouragement initially). Breast-feeding has many advantages, including:
        <ul>
            <li>It is free and available without preparation.</li>
            <li>Boosting the baby's immunity to infection, particularly respiratory tract infections and gastroenteritis, with a consequent reduction in hospitalisations.</li>
            <li>Reducing risk of cot death.</li>
            <li>Promoting bonding between the mother and her baby.</li>
            <li> Protection against later risks of being overweight and obese.</li>
            <li>Reduction in breast and ovarian cancer and diabetes in the mother.</li></ul>
    Initial breast engorgement may cause a lot of discomfort but is usually relieved by good bra support and analgesia.
    Women who are unable to breast-feed or prefer to bottle-feed also need support and advice, including around feeding routines and sterilising.

            <p> <h5 id="PN5">Contraception </h5>

   <p> Contraception is not necessary in the 21 days after childbirth.
    <p>All methods are suitable choices for both breast-feeding and non-breast-feeding women
        Combined hormonal contraceptive (CHC) methods (pill, vaginal ring or patch) should not be started before 21 days, due to the increased risk of thromboembolism in the immediate postpartum period. Previous concerns about hormonal effects on the quality and quantity of milk, passage of hormones to the infant and adverse effects on infant growth if CHC methods are used in breast-feeding women before six months postpartum have not been proven. This led to the UK Medical Eligibility Criteria (UKMEC) being changed in 2016[10].
        The copper intrauterine contraceptive device (IUCD) and the intrauterine system (IUS), unless fitted within 48 hours of delivery, should not be fitted before four weeks postpartum, due to the increased risk of expulsion.
        Sterilisation is usually delayed until at least six weeks post-delivery.
        Fertility awareness methods can be used from day 21 but should not be taught to new users until after periods have restarted.</p>
    <p>The lactational amenorrhoea method is 98% effective if
         <ul>   
             <li> There is complete amenorrhoea.</li>
             <li> The woman is fully or very nearly fully breast-feeding.</li>
             <li> The baby is no more than 6 months old.</li>
          </ul>
